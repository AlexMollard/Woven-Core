## What Actually Helped

### Vulkan Specification

**When I use it:** When validation says something is wrong and I need the exact rule. When I'm using a new 1.4 feature.

**My approach:** Search for the specific function or extension. Read that section. Move on.

### Vulkan 1.4 Release Notes and Extensions

**Why I read this:** See what became core in 1.4. Understand what maintenance extensions do.

**What I learned:** A lot of maintenance extensions just clean up the API. Some add real features. Need to know which is which.

## Extension Documentation I Read

### VK_EXT_shader_object

**Why I read this:** Never used in previous engine. Needed to understand dynamic state requirements and shader object lifecycle.

**What I learned:** Every pipeline state becomes explicit `vkCmdSet*` calls. A lot of state to set per frame.

**My question:** Is this actually better than pipelines? Need to profile the CPU cost.

### VK_EXT_mesh_shader

**My experience:** Experimented before but never committed. This time reading for real usage patterns, not toy examples.

**What helped:** NVIDIA and AMD blog posts on workgroup sizing, meshlet organization, when mesh shaders are worth it.

**What I'm learning:** Not just the API (I know that), but the PATTERNS. How to structure culling. How to organize meshlets.

## Tools I'm Using

### RenderDoc

**My experience:** Used before. Know how to capture frames and inspect state.

**What I'm using it for:** Verifying shader object state. Checking mesh shader output. Confirming my mental model.

### Nsight Graphics (NVIDIA)

**My usage:** Plan to use for deeper profiling once rendering is more complex. Not needed yet for a triangle.

**What I'll learn:** Where GPU time goes. Pipeline utilization. Bottleneck analysis.

### Tracy

**My status:** Integrated. Basic CPU profiling works. GPU zones not added yet.

**Next step:** Add GPU timeline. See actual costs. Measure, don't guess.

## What I Skipped

### Beginner Vulkan Tutorials

**Why I skip them:** I already did Vulkan 1.3. Don't need to relearn instance creation or what a command buffer is.

**What I look for:** Advanced topics. GPU-driven patterns. Real engine techniques. Blog posts from 2024+ about real-world usage.

**Reality:** Most Vulkan content is still beginner focused. I filter for advanced material.

## Community Resources

### /r/vulkan (Reddit)

**How I use it:** Search for specific questions before asking. Most common questions are already answered.

**What I learned:** Good for seeing how others solve problems. Lots of experienced Vulkan devs there.

**Caveat:** Still see a lot of old render pass / pipeline advice. Filter for modern patterns.

### Khronos Vulkan Discord

**What it is:** Real-time help from Vulkan developers and API designers.

**My experience:** Haven't needed to ask much yet. Validation and documentation have answered most questions.

**When I'll use it:** If I hit something truly confusing or need clarification on spec behavior.

## My Learning Strategy

1. **Profile everything:** I know the API. Now I want to understand the COST. Tracy shows real numbers. Measure, don't guess.

2. **Try features I've avoided:** Shader objects, mesh shaders - I've stuck with traditional paths before. Time to commit to modern patterns.

3. **Break things intentionally:** Still do this. Best way to understand validation and what's actually required.

4. **Read other engine code:** See how real engines (The Forge, bgfx, etc.) handle shader objects and mesh shaders in practice.

5. **Expand scale:** I've done bindless at small scale. Now 16K slots. What changes at scale?

## My Starting Point

**What I bring:**
- Previous Vulkan 1.3 renderer with dynamic rendering and bindless
- GLSL experience (Slang syntax feels natural)
- Understanding of synchronization2 and modern barriers  
- Knowledge of what driver bugs feel like (timeline semaphores crash my PC)

**What I'm expanding:**
- Shader objects in real use (never committed before)
- Mesh shaders as primary path (only experimented before)
- Vulkan 1.4 features and baseline
- Deeper performance understanding
- GPU-driven patterns at scale

**My goal:** Push beyond what I've done before. Not just relearning - expanding and refining.
