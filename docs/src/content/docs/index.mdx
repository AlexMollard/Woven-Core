description: Learn modern graphics programming through code and rationale.
---

Welcome! This documentation explains **why** things are built the way they are, not just **what** they do.

## Philosophy

This is a **learning project** focused on:
- Modern Vulkan features (shader objects, dynamic rendering, mesh shaders)
- GPU-driven rendering techniques
- Understanding trade-offs and design decisions

**Not a production engine.** Not trying to support every GPU. Not optimizing for the widest compatibility. Learning modern techniques that production engines use.

## How to use these docs

**Engine Docs:** Explains architectural decisions and why features were chosen. Read this to understand the thought process.

**Vulkan Learning:** Maps Vulkan concepts to the codebase. Learn by reading code alongside explanations.

**Notes:** Working journal of decisions, progress, and open questions. See the messy process, not just the polished result.

## Start here

### Understand the architecture

- [Why the system model?](./engine/architecture/)
- [What does each system do?](./engine/systems/)
- [Why modern Vulkan?](./engine/graphics/)

### Learn Vulkan through code

- [Learning plan](./vulkan/learning-plan/) - Staged approach to understanding Vulkan
- [Code map](./vulkan/code-map/) - Where concepts live in the codebase
- [Resources](./vulkan/resources/) - What to read, what to skip

### Track progress

- [Decision log](./notes/decision-log/) - Why things are the way they are
- [Dev log](./notes/devlog/) - Daily progress
- [Open questions](./notes/questions/) - Things to figure out

## Contributing to docs

When you learn something or make a decision:
1. Write it in [Notes](./notes/) immediately
2. When it stabilizes, promote to [Engine Docs](./engine/)
3. Link to code liberally - context matters
