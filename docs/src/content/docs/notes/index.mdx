title: Notes
description: Working notes, decisions, and open questions.
---

This section is for **in-progress thinking**. Use it to capture:
- Why you made a decision today
- What alternatives you considered and rejected
- What broke and how you fixed it
- What you want to try next

When something stabilizes, promote it to [Engine Docs](../engine/).

## How to use this section

**Decision log:** "Why did I choose X over Y?" Write it down NOW, not later when you forget.

**Dev log:** Quick daily notes. What worked? What didn't? What's blocking you?

**Open questions:** Things you don't know yet or need to research.
