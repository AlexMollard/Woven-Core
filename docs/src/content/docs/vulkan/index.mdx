title: Expanding My Vulkan Knowledge
description: Taking my Vulkan 1.3 experience and pushing into 1.4 features.

## Why This Exists

I've done Vulkan 1.3 before - built a renderer with dynamic rendering and bindless descriptors. WovenCore is about pushing further into **Vulkan 1.4** and expanding on what I already know.

**What I'm building on:**
- Already done: dynamic rendering, bindless descriptors, synchronization2
- Expanding: shader objects (never used in previous engine), mesh shaders (experimented but not fully utilized)
- Learning: Vulkan 1.4 features, GPU-driven workflows at scale
- Refining: better patterns, performance understanding, modern techniques

This section is my personal notes on expanding my Vulkan knowledge. It's not a tutorial - it's me documenting what I'm learning as I build WovenCore.

## My Learning Philosophy

**I already know the Vulkan mental model.** I've built a 1.3 renderer before. This is about:
- Committing to features I only experimented with (shader objects, mesh shaders)
- Understanding performance deeply, not just making it work
- Pushing into Vulkan 1.4 and modern baselines
- Expanding GPU-driven patterns at scale

**How I approach expansion:**
- Try the thing I've been avoiding (shader objects instead of pipelines)
- Profile to understand real costs, not assumed costs
- Break things to confirm my mental model is correct
- Document trade-offs and lessons learned

## How I'm Organizing This

1. **[Learning Plan](./learning-plan/)** - Breaking down what I'm expanding on
   - Stage 1: Setup I'm already comfortable with (just updated to 1.4)
   - Stage 2: Features I'm actually learning (shader objects, mesh shaders in real use)
   - Stage 3: Patterns I'm refining (bindless at scale, resource management)
   - Stage 4: Deep performance understanding (profiling, optimization patterns)

2. **[Resources](./resources/)** - What helped me expand (not beginner tutorials)
   - Vulkan 1.4 release notes and maintenance extensions
   - Advanced blog posts and real engine patterns
   - Tools for profiling and deep analysis

## What I Already Know

**From previous Vulkan 1.3 renderer:**
- Dynamic rendering (no render passes)
- Bindless descriptors
- Synchronization2 barriers
- Basic setup flow and resource management
- VMA for memory allocation

**What I'm expanding on:**
- Shader objects (replacing pipelines - never used in previous engine)
- Mesh shaders (experimented before, now actually using them)
- Vulkan 1.4 features and patterns
- GPU-driven techniques at larger scale
- Better understanding of performance characteristics

## What's New in This Project

**Vulkan 1.4 focus:**
- Maintenance extensions that became core
- Modern feature baseline (no legacy fallbacks)
- Learning what's actually relevant in 2026

**Technical expansion:**
- Shader objects for real (not just experiments)
- Mesh shaders as primary geometry path
- Slang instead of GLSL (coming from GLSL background)
- Deeper understanding of synchronization patterns

**My context:**
- Timeline semaphores crash my hardware (driver bug)
- Prefer explicit control over abstraction layers
- Building on proven patterns, refining and expanding
